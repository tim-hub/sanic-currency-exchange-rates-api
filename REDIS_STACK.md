## How it works

### How the data is stored:

The data is store as a document, for each day of the currency rates.

```json
{
   "2020-01-01": {
      "USD": 1,
      "EUR": 1.1,
      "AUD": 0.97
   }
}
```

### How the data is accessed:

In python codes, the data is accessed through a simple `get`
```python
r.json().get('2020-01-01')
```

### Performance Benchmarks

![postgres performance](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tee5tld95fsfs983ja7t.png)
![redis json performance](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cbavn3fsbabi2p41wlgh.png)

[Load test](tests/load-test.js) is used here to measure the performance.
- same Machine (my personal macbook laptop)
- same spec for DB 
  - 10GB Volume
  - Same ARM64 Instance

The 2 key results here are `iterations` (higher is better) and `iteration_duration(avg)`(lower is better)

| Fact | Postgres | Redis Stack |
| :---: |:--------:|:-----------:|
| Iterations | 25.26/s  |   5.52/s    |
| Iteration Duration | 560.15ms |    5.53s    |

This performance benchmark is surprising to myself as well, Redis as a well performanced DB, 
in most of time, it give a very good result of performance.

In sum, this performance compare may not be objective, the reasons behind it requires more researching. These are some potential reasons I assume,

1.Min Specs for different DB are difference, even the spec for Postgres and Redis Stack here are the same, but their min spec requirements may be different.
   - [Postgres](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/01_requirements_overview/): 1 GHz processor. 2 GB of RAM. 512 MB of HDD.
   - [Redis](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/administering/designing-production/hardware-requirements/): 2.6GHz(2 CPUs), 4 GB of Ram, 10 GD of HDD  (Redis Stack supposed to be higher) 

2.Decimal in Python as a class could not be saved directly as a JSON attribute in RedisJSOM, 
so it was stores as string, and it will be converted to Decimal when read. This may slow the APP down.

3.Query was not used (RedisSearch) was not used, so when query history data, a loop of `GET` are sent to DB, which is not efficient


In sum, this comparing result doesn't tell which is better between Postgres and RedisJSON, it only says that at current stage, at current DB Instance spec, for this API,
postgres gives better performance, and the way of `Decimal Convert` and `Loop of Get` in Application level slows the app too. 
(If anyone knows better about Redis to solve these problems, please let me know). So this comparing seems not very fair.









## How to run it locally?


### Prerequisites

- python 3.10
- poetry >1.0
- redis stack, please make sure you have a remote Redis Instance running, feel free to get one free from  [Redis Stack database in the cloud](https://developer.redis.com/create/rediscloud).
- docker 20.10.xx (optional)


### Local installation and development


#### Local Python App Development

0. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/tim-hub/sanic-currency-exchange-rates-api.git`
0. `export REDIS_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379'` (use your own redis stack url)
0. `export USE_REDIS = 1`
1. `poetry install`
2. `poetry run python src/main.py`


#### Through Docker 

`docker build -t rate-api . && docker run --name rate-api -t -i -e REDIS_URL=redis://your-remote-redis:6379 -e USE_REDIS=1 rate-api`

or 

Use a docker image.

```bash
docker run --name rate-api -p 8000:8000 -e REDIS_URL=redis://your-remote-redis:6379 -e USE_REDIS=1  ghcr.io/tim-hub/sanic-currency-exchange-rates-api:v2.3.0
```

## Deployment

This app is wrapped in a docker container, so it could be deployer to any platform (which supports docker), From AWS, Heroku to K8s, 

the only requirements for it are 2 environment variables.
- REDIS_URL
- USE_REDIS


For example run in local machine:
```shell
docker run --name rate-api -p 8000:8000 -e REDIS_URL=redis://your-remote-redis:6379 -e USE_REDIS=1  ghcr.io/tim-hub/sanic-currency-exchange-rates-api:v2.3.0
```
